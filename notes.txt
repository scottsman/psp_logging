# User stories:

## Starting a coding process.
From the terminal I would indicate I want to do a psp action by typing 'psp'.
The second argument would be 'start'.
The third argument would be 'code'.
This would start a new psp process that would be recording how long my coding process is.

## Stopping a coding process.
From the terminal I would type 'psp stop' and psp would stop my current process.
I could explicitly stop the coding process but it's implied because I can only have one process
running at a time.
I could also implicitly stop a process by starting a new process, such as 'psp start code-review'.

#Under the hood:

When starting a new process, a new process of a certain type is created (such as, 'code',
'code-review', 'triage', 'p2p', etc... (to be fleshed out)).
That process records the start time and when the process is ended it records the end time.
The total time is recorded into a database (or file) of my total processes.
That database (or file) would be queryable so I can get an idea of how i'm spending my time during
the day/week.  I could also hook in some fancy graphs towards the end of development also.
